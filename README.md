# trying-out-webpack
Notes and small sample project using [Webpack][1]. Before I opted for Webpack I took into consideration  other options:

* [Browserify][2], it only supports [CommonJS][3] modules.
* [jspm][4], supports **ES6 modules** but at the moment of writing this, the project wasn't as mature as Webpack.
